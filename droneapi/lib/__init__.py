    The main vehicle API

    Asynchronous notification on change of vehicle state is available by registering observers (callbacks) for attribute or
    parameter changes.

    Most vehicle state is exposed through python attributes.  (i.e. vehicle.location, etc...)  And most of these attributes are
    auto populated based on the capabilities of the particular autopilot we are talking to.

    Particular autopilots/vehicles may define different attributes from this standard list (extra batteries, GPIOs, etc...)
    However if a standard attribute is defined it must follow the rules specified below.

    To prevent name clashes the following naming convention should be used:
    ap_<name> - For autopilot specific parameters (apm 2.5, pixhawk etc...).  Example:
    user_<name> - For user specific parameters

    Standard attributes & types:

    ================= =======================================================
    Name              Type
    ================= =======================================================
    location          Location
    waypoint_home     Waypoint
    attitude          Attitude
    velocity          a three element list [ vx, vy, vz ] (in meter/sec)
    mode              VehicleMode
    airspeed          double (FIXME - should this move somewhere else?)
    groundspeed       double
    gps_0             GPSInfo
    battery_0_soc     double
    battery_0_volt    double
    armed             boolean
    channel_override  Dictionary (channelName -> value) (where channel name is 1,2,3, etc...)
    channel_readback  Dictionary (channelName -> value) (read only)
    ================= =======================================================

    Autopilot specific attributes & types:

    ================= =======================================================
    Name              Type
    ================= =======================================================
    ap_pin5_mode      string (adc, dout, din)
    ap_pin5_value     double (0, 1, 2.3 etc...)
    ================= =======================================================

    channel_override/channel_readback documentation:
    In the previous version of this API I used the 'tried and true'
    rc_override terminology.  However I've changed rc_override to be
    channel_override with a dictionary as the argument.
    (This idea is from @rmackay9 - thanks!)

    Strings will be defined per vehicle type ('pitch', 'yaw', 'roll' etc...)
    and rather than setting channel 3 to 1400 (for instance), you will pass
    in a dict with 'throttle':1200.  If you do not want to override particular
    channels, you should not populate them in the dictionary.

    It is worth noting by using a single dictionary it is guaranteed that all
    multi-channel changes are updated atomically.

    This change will be nice in two ways:

    * we can hide (eventually we can deprecate) any notion of rc channel
    numbers at all.
    * vehicles can eventually define new 'channels' for overridden values.

    Remaining FIXMEs:

    * FIXME - how to address the units issue?  Merely with documentation or some other way?
    * FIXME - is there any benefit of using lists rather than tuples for these attributes
